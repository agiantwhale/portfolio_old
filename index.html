                <h3>Student by Day, Hacker by Night.</h3>
                <p class="hidden-xs">Hi, my name is Jae. I was born in Korea, on August 18th, 1995. Some people call me a programmer, some call me a math nerd, some call me a designer. I like to refer to myself as a "hacker", or someone who thinks of a clever solution to a hard problem. I love to write code and I regularly attend collegiate hackathons. I like to believe that someday, the projects I work on will be able to solve big problems humanity faces. Despite the big dreams, in reality, I am currently enrolled in Cranbrook Kingswood, graduating in 2015. I work hard in what I can do currently that will lead to success in the future.  I also have a rabbit pet, "Mr. Rabbit" in Seoul - rabbits are my favorite animals. You are now reading my portfolio, where I show off my work.</p>

              <h4>Lemoneda</h4>
              <p>Lemoneda is an anonymous social network for high school students. After a very successful run of CraneShout.com (a similar site especially for Cranbrook Kingswood students), I've lead the same team to expand out services to nearby schools. On Lemoneda, students can freely share their thoughts, ideas, confessions, discuss topics, and get advice.</p>

              <h4>Segment</h4>
              <p>Bored during summer break, I've decided to make a game. To get into iOS and Android development, I wanted to try developing something for mobile. The result is Segment - a near perfect clone of the IGF Winner Perfection. The entire game was programmed within a week, and I've learned a lot about mobile development through the process.</p>

              <h4>moon.chase.star</h4>
              <p>moon.chase.star was the game I've developed after the lessons I've learned from Round &amp; Round. Although I've never finished Round &amp; Round, I took a lot of the gameplay concepts and simplified the overall game, from a full-blown 3D game to a simple 2D platformer, flashy graphics to a black and white tone, and so on. I've been able to complete the game within three months, and was successfully published through <a href="http://www.desura.com/">Desura</a>.</p>

              <h4>CheckUp</h4>
              <p>CheckUp is a intelligent building management platform I've participated in during the internship at <a href="http://www.popcorn5.com/">Popcorn5 Inc</a>. The service aims to simplify the process of building inspection and maintenance, while providing useful analytical insights, leading to efficient decisions on building evaluation. I've been assigned to frontend development team, where I worked on building their administration backend with AngularJS.</p>

              <h4>GimmeGlasses</h4>
              <p>GimmeGlasses is a weekend hack I've made over a weekend. Having just learned how to use the useful OpenCV library, I've hacked up a simple script that automatically detects eyes in a photograph and puts glasses on them.</p>

              <h4>Round &amp; Round</h4>
              <p>Round &amp; Round was my first attempt at creating a video game. Having just learned C++, I purchased a copy of Leadwerks and started working on a ball-rolling puzzle game. Although it was over-ambitious for my first attempt, I've learned various lessons through the process of developing the video game - from various programming techniques and know-hows to project management, goal settings, and work scheduling.</p>

              <p>Readly is a reading list reminder service that when a user tweets a blog post or an article, the service reminds the user two or three days later through email. By repeatedly providing a reminder to read over the information, it encourages and improves memorization of the data</p>

              <h4>WhiteBox</h4>
              <p>WhiteBox is a hack I've made over a weekend. A user may ask a question, and the site attempts to search Wikipedia for an answer. It uses the Python NLTK library to build a MQL query from the user's question, and executes it over various databases to find an answer.</p>
